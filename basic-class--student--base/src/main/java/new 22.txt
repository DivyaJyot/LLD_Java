I will begin with the quote I read somewhere: "Four wheels move the body, two wheels move the soul".
As a new year's resolution, I started cycling as a step towards fitness after a gap of more than 20 years.

I (Shakti Kumar) shifted in pc15/802 in Oct 2018 along with my wife(Divya).
We were blessed with twins (Aashvi and Ayaansh) in August of 2019. Raising twins and doing so without quitting our jobs was always a challenge for both of us.
We hardly ever had time for ourselves over the last four years. The sleeping patterns of both kids are different; in fact, one wakes up early while the other sleeps late at night. Meanwhile, I gained a lot of weight, and I literally was not getting any time for workouts. Before 2018, I used to be active in different sports like running (participated in many recognised half marathons, including the Ladakh Marathon), table tennis, cricket, etc.
So in the new year (Jan 2023) I decided to wake up early, much earlier than the kids( (between 3-4 AM), to workout. In spite of such cold weather and early hours , I got an idea to start cycling (as due to the presence of so many stray dogs, jogging in the early hours is not safe, and also the gym won't be open at that time).
From here I started my journey of solo cycling (it was difficult to get someone's company at such an early hour) around the wish town and soon I developed a passion for this.
In February, when I learned about the HCL Cyclothon event posted by someone in a cluster WhatsApp group, I decided to participate.
Though I was not well prepared, I was able to complete the race in a timing 2 hr 22 min.It was an amazing experience riding with more than 1100 cyclists from different parts of the country.
It's always more fun to go cycling or running in a group.
I love cycling as it makes me feel lighter (physically as well as mentally). I would like to end this with a beautiful quote:
You can't be sad while riding a bicycle!
So, keep pedalling.
